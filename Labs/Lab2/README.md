## Overview

In this lab, I learned the basics of web development starting with how to make a simple html page and then some simple in line JS code and apis. The lab is then expanded by using AJAx, CSS, and jQuery. 

## Task 1: Basic HTML with forms, and JavaScript

In this task, I created an HTML page and then incorporated some JS to have in line tags, a digital clock, and an email button. 

a. HTML

In this part, I followed the templates and codes in the lecture. It was not hard to replicate, and it taught me the basics of HTML all over again. The code is found under the Lab2 folder. 

b. Simple Javascript

This part was a bit harder to replicate, but the lecture was very direct and informative on what to add and how to write the code. I liked added the clock feature and have never seen anything like it. It also showed how to display things with a click. Below is a screenshot of the finished product.

## Task 2: Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web API integration

This task will go over incorporating Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web API integration 

a. Ajax

In this part I added the HTML code as shown in the lecture to add a server repsonse feature on the page. When entering a user input and clicking submit, it will display what the user inputted right below it. The console and network also show the response. I then added another one but this time without a form. An Ajax request works by consturcting an XMLHttpRequest when the user interacts with the webpage. The server then responds to the request using the open and send methods and then using the echo.php to echo back the data received. The onreadystatechange will check if the request has been completed and successfully. When this is all done, the page is then updated with the response data without ever reloading the page. There are 3 screenshots below for this part.

b. CSS

In this part, I added CSS using inline, internal, and external as shown in the lecture. The screenshot below shows the finished result.
