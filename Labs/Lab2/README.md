## Overview

In this lab, I learned the basics of web development starting with how to make a simple html page and then some simple in line JS code and apis. The lab is then expanded by using AJAx, CSS, and jQuery. 

## Task 1: Basic HTML with forms, and JavaScript

In this task, I created an HTML page and then incorporated some JS to have in line tags, a digital clock, and an email button. 

## a. HTML

In this part, I followed the templates and codes in the lecture. It was not hard to replicate, and it taught me the basics of HTML all over again. The code is found under the Lab2 folder. 

## b. Simple Javascript

This part was a bit harder to replicate, but the lecture was very direct and informative on what to add and how to write the code. I liked added the clock feature and have never seen anything like it. It also showed how to display things with a click. Below is a screenshot of the finished product.
