## Co-op Work Experience
I have worked as a Front End and Full Stack developer at Siemens, utilizing technologies such as AngularJS, C#, React, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Java. During my time there, I gained valuable experience in teamwork, pair programming, and agile development practices. Before my co-op roles, I worked as a server at multiple restaurants, which honed my customer service and multitasking skills.

## Project Sought
I am looking for a project that would be impressive on my resume and potentially scalable into a business venture. My goal is to work on something unique and substantial, with real-world applications that can benefit a large user base. I am particularly interested in projects that align with my passions and allow me to collaborate effectively in a team, practicing efficient scrum and agile development methodologies.

I have several ideas in mind but am still assessing their feasibility and impact. My ideal project would not only showcase my technical skills but also foster innovation and create tangible value for users.
